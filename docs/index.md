# Fair Compensation for Open Source

The **CoopyrightCode License** redefines how open source contributors are compensated for their work. Traditionally, contributions to open source projects have relied on a **volunteer-based model**, where recognition is primarily symbolic. However, this approach often does not reflect the **real value of contributions** and does little to encourage sustained participation over the long term. 

CoopyrightCode aims to change this by offering **fair compensation** to all contributors — developers, designers, documentation writers, and others — based on the **actual impact** of their contributions in commercial products.

At the crossroads of **open source licensing** and **blockchain technology**, this license introduces an innovative framework that combines **transparency**, **traceability**, and **legal flexibility**. Through a system of **smart contracts**, each contribution—whether it's a line of code, a creative design, or technical documentation—is immutably recorded, ensuring **automated compensation** based on predefined rules. This is done via a **token-based economy** where contributors are rewarded proportionally to the value of their contributions.

## #1 Key Components of CoopyrightCode

1. **The CoopyrightCode License**

    * An open source license with specific clauses that enable the **compensation** of contributors.
    * Clear definition of the **rights of use, modification,** and **distribution** of software under this license.

2. **Blockchain and Smart Contracts**

    * A **dedicated blockchain** records all contributions, ensuring transparency and immutability.
    * **Smart contracts** automate the compensation process, using algorithms to evaluate the **value** of each contribution based on criteria like quality, impact, and adoption.

3. **Decentralized Validation Mechanism**

    * A network of **validators**, selected based on reputation and expertise, evaluate and validate submitted contributions.
    * A **consensus voting mechanism** among the validators determines whether contributions are accepted before being recorded on the blockchain.

4. **Token-Based Compensation**

    * A **token economy** rewards contributors with tokens, distributed in proportion to the value of their contributions.
    * **Inflation management mechanisms** maintain the long-term value of the tokens, ensuring sustainable growth of the ecosystem.

## #2 The Role of Alien6

This project is sponsored by **Alien6** and developed as part of their **R&D program**. Consequently, the development of the CoopyrightCode License adheres to specific **research and development constraints**, including the protection of intellectual property and alignment with Alien6's broader innovation strategies. These constraints ensure that, while the project champions open source values, it remains fully compatible with **commercial applications** and **corporate compliance requirements**.

## #3 Work in Progress

The **CoopyrightCode License** is currently a **work in progress**, with ongoing development and refinement. For those interested in the core principles and features, we invite you to explore the **Light version** of the license. This version provides a simplified yet functional framework suitable for many open source projects while maintaining the essential values of **transparency** and **fair compensation** for contributors.
