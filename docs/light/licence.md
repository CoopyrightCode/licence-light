# CoopyrightCode Light License (v1.1)

This license grants free, non-commercial use of the code under the conditions outlined below. The code is provided without warranty or maintenance, and users are informed that a complete version of this license will be published in the future, with more detailed terms, including contribution traceability via blockchain and remuneration mechanisms based on the value of contributions.

## 1. Granted Rights

This section outlines the rights that users have under the CoopyrightCode Light License. It allows for wide use of the code but strictly for non-commercial purposes.

- **Use, copy, modify, and distribute**: Users may use, copy, modify, and distribute the source code, provided that it is only for non-commercial purposes. This ensures that the code remains freely available to the community but limits its exploitation in commercial settings.
- **Create derivative works**: Users can create derivative works from the source code, but these derivatives must also be used solely for non-commercial purposes. Any alterations or improvements must still comply with the non-commercial intent of this license.
- **Redistribute modifications**: Users are permitted to share modified versions of the code, as long as the same terms of this license are applied to the modified code.

## 2. Prohibition of Commercial Use

This license explicitly prohibits any use of the code for commercial purposes. 

- **Non-commercial limitation**: The code and any derivative works cannot be used for commercial purposes, meaning that the code cannot be included in any product or service that generates revenue. This prevents the code from being used in for-profit software or services without a proper commercial agreement.
- **Separate license for commercial use**: If someone wishes to use the code for commercial purposes, they must obtain a separate commercial license. The terms for such commercial use will be provided in the full version of the CoopyrightCode License, which will introduce the mechanisms for commercial exploitation and remuneration.

## 3. User Obligations

To ensure proper credit and adherence to the terms of the license, users must fulfill the following obligations:

- **Attribution**: Users must give proper credit to the original author(s). This includes mentioning the name of the author and providing a link to the original repository or the license text in any distribution or modification of the code. Proper attribution is a key part of the open-source ethos and ensures recognition for the original creators.
- **Preservation of legal notices**: All copyright notices, disclaimers, and other legal notices must remain intact and unaltered. Users cannot remove these notices in any distributed or modified version of the code.
- **License inclusion**: Any redistribution of the code, whether modified or not, must include a copy of this license or a reference to it, ensuring that all users of the code are aware of the applicable terms.

## 4. No Warranty and No Maintenance

This section limits the liability of the authors and clarifies the lack of support or guarantees provided with the code.

- **No warranties**: The code is provided "as-is", without any warranties of any kind. This means the authors do not guarantee that the code will function as expected, be free of bugs, or be suitable for any particular purpose. Users take full responsibility for how they use the code.
- **No obligation for maintenance**: The authors have no obligation to provide support, updates, or bug fixes for the code. This section is common in many open-source licenses and protects the authors from being held responsible for future maintenance.
- **No liability for third-party claims**: The authors make no guarantees that the code will not infringe on third-party intellectual property rights, and they are not liable for any legal claims that may arise from its use.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

This section further limits the responsibility of the authors in case of issues or damages that may occur as a result of using the code.

- **Direct and indirect damages**: In no case shall the authors be liable for any damages, whether direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential. This includes any loss of data, operational failures, or financial losses. The use of the code is entirely at the userâ€™s own risk.
- **No compensation for losses**: Users cannot claim compensation for any damages, even if they result from the use or misuse of the code. This limitation protects the authors from being sued for damages in any legal jurisdiction.

## 6. License Evolution

This section informs users of upcoming changes and additions that will be part of the full version of the CoopyrightCode License.

- **Blockchain-based contribution tracking**: The full version of the license will introduce blockchain-based mechanisms to track contributions, ensuring transparency and accountability for each contributor. This tracking will help assign value to contributions and ensure they are recognized.
- **Remuneration based on contribution value**: Contributors may be remunerated based on the value of their contributions, as determined by predefined rules or blockchain-based smart contracts. The goal of the full version is to offer a fair compensation model for contributors whose work adds significant value to a project.
- **Additional conditions for commercial use**: The full version may introduce new terms, especially regarding the commercial use of the code. Users will need to comply with these additional conditions if they wish to use the code for commercial purposes.
