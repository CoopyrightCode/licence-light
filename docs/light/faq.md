# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use this code for a commercial project?**  
> **A:** No, this code is currently licensed for non-commercial use only. A future version of the license will include options for commercial use under specific terms. If you are interested in using the code commercially, you will need to wait for the full version of the CoopyrightCode License or contact the project maintainers for specific commercial licensing options.

**Q: Will I receive support for issues I encounter?**  
> **A:** No, the code is provided as-is, without any support, maintenance, or warranty. The authors of the code are under no obligation to provide fixes, updates, or assistance with issues you may encounter. You can, however, fork the code and modify it to resolve any issues you find.

---

**Q: How will the license evolve?**  
> **A:** The CoopyrightCode Light License (v1.1) is a preliminary version of a more complete license that will be released in the future. The full version will include blockchain-based contribution tracking and a remuneration system to compensate contributors based on the value of their work. The new version may also introduce additional terms for commercial use. Stay tuned for updates, which will be published in this repository.

**Q: How will blockchain be used to track contributions?**  
> **A:** In the future version of the CoopyrightCode License, blockchain technology will be integrated to ensure transparent and immutable tracking of contributions. Each contribution will be recorded on the blockchain, making it easier to verify who contributed to a project, when, and what exactly was contributed. This tracking system will allow for fair attribution and potential remuneration for contributors.

**Q: Can I create derivative works from the code?**  
> **A:** Yes, you are allowed to create derivative works, modify the code, and distribute those modifications as long as it remains for non-commercial purposes. You must also include the original CoopyrightCode Light License (v1.1) in any derivative works and properly credit the original authors.

---

**Q: Do I have to credit the original authors if I use the code?**  
> **A:** Yes, you are required to credit the original authors when using, modifying, or distributing the code. Attribution must include a link to the original repository or the license text and must not remove or alter any existing copyright notices.

---

**Q: Can non-profit organizations use this code?**  
> **A:** Yes, non-profit organizations can use the code as long as the use is non-commercial. If the non-profit organization generates revenue from the use of the code (for example, by selling services or products that rely on the code), this would likely be considered commercial use and would require a separate commercial license.

---

**Q: What happens if I accidentally use the code for a commercial project?**  
> **A:** If the code is used in a commercial project without the proper license, it would be a violation of the CoopyrightCode Light License. You would need to either remove the code from your commercial project or contact the maintainers to discuss obtaining a commercial license. Unauthorized commercial use could lead to legal action, depending on the terms of the full license when released.

---

**Q: Can I contribute to a project that uses the CoopyrightCode Light License?**  
> **A:** Yes, you can contribute to projects licensed under the CoopyrightCode Light License. However, by contributing, you agree that your contributions will also be licensed under the same CoopyrightCode Light License, meaning they can only be used for non-commercial purposes.

---

**Q: Will contributors be compensated in the future?**  
> **A:** Yes, the full version of the CoopyrightCode License will include a remuneration system that compensates contributors based on the value of their contributions. This system will leverage blockchain technology to ensure transparent and fair remuneration. The exact details of the remuneration process will be outlined in the future version of the license.

**Q: How do I know if my usage is non-commercial?**  
> **A:** Non-commercial use refers to any use of the code that does not generate direct or indirect revenue. For example, using the code in an open-source project or for personal education purposes would be considered non-commercial. If you're unsure whether your use qualifies as non-commercial, it's best to err on the side of caution and contact the project maintainers for clarification.

**Q: What are the key differences between the CoopyrightCode Light License and other popular licenses like MIT or GPL?**  
> **A:** The CoopyrightCode Light License (v1.1) is similar to permissive licenses like MIT in that it allows for broad usage, modification, and distribution of the code. However, unlike MIT, it explicitly prohibits commercial use unless a separate commercial license is obtained. The GPL, on the other hand, imposes "copyleft" conditions, requiring derivative works to also be licensed under the GPL. CoopyrightCode Light does not impose this requirement, but restricts use to non-commercial purposes only.

**Q: How can I stay informed about updates to the license?**  
> **A:** The best way to stay informed about updates to the CoopyrightCode License is to follow this repository or sign up for updates if available. Any significant changes, including the release of the full version of the license, will be posted here.

---

**Q: Will there be a process for transitioning from non-commercial to commercial use?**  
> **A:** Yes, when the full version of the CoopyrightCode License is released, there will be a clear process for transitioning from non-commercial to commercial use. Users who wish to use the code commercially will be required to obtain a commercial license and comply with the new terms, including potential fees or royalties depending on the value of their contributions.

**Q: What should I do if I have more questions?**  
> **A:** If you have any additional questions not covered in this FAQ, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers or consult the documentation provided in the repository. More details and contact information will be provided as the full version of the license approaches release.
