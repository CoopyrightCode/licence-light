# Transforming Open Source Compensation

The world of open source software has profoundly transformed the IT industry, enabling thousands of projects to emerge and accelerating innovation. However, despite widespread use in commercial products, the current open source licensing model fails to provide **fair compensation** for contributorsâ€”developers, designers, documentation writers, testers, and other key participants.

This lack of recognition limits contributor engagement and threatens the long-term sustainability of open source projects. Additionally, challenges related to **copyright management** and **contribution traceability** remain unresolved. The absence of transparency in existing models prevents a revenue distribution that is proportional to the actual impact of each contribution in commercial products, thus undermining fair compensation.

## Our Mission

The **CoopyrightCode License** envisions a transformed open source ecosystem by delivering a solution that:

- **Fairly compensates** each contributor (code, design, documentation, etc.) based on the value of their work.
- **Ensures transparency and traceability** of contributions through blockchain, eliminating any ambiguity regarding the origin and impact of individual contributions.
- **Automates revenue distribution** using smart contracts, ensuring compliance with legal terms defined by the license.
- **Facilitates adoption** by companies with a clear and accessible legal and technological framework for integrating open source contributions into commercial products while respecting contributor rights.

Our goal is to build a **sustainable ecosystem** where the interests of both contributors and businesses are aligned, fostering **fair, transparent,** and long-term collaboration.
